- Removed inline styles from mobile menu in favor of CSS classes
- Replaced inline data-position attributes with proper CSS classes
- Enhanced interactive map component to use CSS classes instead of direct style manipulation
- Implemented consistent CSS transitions for all interactive elements
- Created unified animation API with proper event handling
- Exposed animation API through window for non-module compatibility
- Updated tests to match new implementation
- Added deprecation notices for legacy animation functions
- Removed redundant window exposure for AnimationSystem
- Removed more inline style manipulations in favor of CSS classes
- Completely removed deprecated animation utilities in favor of the unified AnimationSystem API
- Deleted redundant legacy animation code for a cleaner codebase
- Simplified animation bridge to only expose the new unified API

## Details: Phase 5.5 UI Refactoring & CSS Best Practices

After addressing critical mobile menu and animation issues in Phase 5, we implemented a proper CSS/JS architecture:

### Mobile Menu Refactoring:
- Separate state management (JS) from presentation (CSS)
- Replace direct style manipulation with CSS class toggles
- Implement proper CSS transitions using transform/opacity instead of display/visibility
- Add transition event listeners to replace setTimeout-based animation locks
- Fix event propagation issues with proper event delegation

### CSS Architecture Improvements:
- Create a proper state machine for UI components with clear state transitions
- Use transform-based animations for better performance
- Implement the checkbox hack for simple UI toggles where appropriate
- Establish a documented z-index scale to prevent stacking context issues
- Use pointer-events strategically to manage interaction during animations

### Animation Framework Enhancement:
- Refactor animation bridge to follow singleton pattern
- Create unified API for animations that works in both module and non-module contexts
- Implement animation queue to prevent animation conflicts
- Add feature detection for progressive enhancement

This phase fixed the technical debt introduced by expedient hotfixes and established a solid foundation for future UI components.

## Details: Phase 6 CI/CD Integration

After completing the UI refactoring in Phase 5.5, we're now focusing on establishing a robust CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and automate deployments:

### GitHub Actions Implementation:
- Create workflows for automated testing on push and pull requests
- Set up build verification for all branches
- Implement test coverage reporting
- Configure deployment workflows

### Pre-commit Hooks:
- Set up Husky for Git hooks management
- Configure lint-staged for running tests on staged files
- Add ESLint for code quality checks
- Implement automated code formatting with Prettier

### Deployment Automation:
- Create deployment scripts for various environments
- Implement environment-specific configuration
- Set up continuous deployment to staging environment
- Configure manual approval for production deployments

### Code Quality Checks:
- Integrate ESLint for static code analysis
- Add browser compatibility checks
- Implement bundle size monitoring
- Configure performance budget checks

This phase will establish a solid foundation for maintaining code quality and streamlining the development workflow.
