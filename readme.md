# Porcupine-Cross Cyclocross Website

A testable, modular implementation of the Prologue Cyclocross Race website.

## Original Project Plan

### Phase 1: Setup Testing Infrastructure
- Install Jest and configure for ES6 support
- Create test directory structure
- Set up basic tests and assertions
- Establish testing environment for DOM testing

### Phase 2: Code Modularization
- Break up monolithic script.js into smaller components
- Extract core functionality into separate modules
- Create utilities for DOM manipulation and event handling
- Implement event bus for component communication
- Update HTML to use modular JavaScript

### Phase 3: Refactor Components
- Refactor each component to be testable
- Implement dependency injection
- Decouple UI manipulation from business logic
- Make core functionality pure functions where possible

### Phase 4: Test Implementation
- Implement unit tests for all components
- Add integration tests for component interactions
- Create component tests for UI functionality
- Develop E2E tests for critical user flows

### Phase 5: Coverage Optimization
- Analyze test coverage with Jest
- Identify and address coverage gaps
- Refactor code to improve testability
- Aim for 100% code coverage

### Phase 5.5: UI Refactoring & CSS Best Practices
- Implement proper CSS architecture for UI components
- Refactor mobile menu using CSS best practices
- Enhance animation framework with unified API
- Fix event handling and propagation issues
- Replace timeout-based animations with CSS transitions
- Implement proper state management for UI components

### Phase 6: CI/CD Integration ðŸš§
- âœ… Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
- âœ… Configure pre-commit hooks for test verification
- âœ… Create code quality checks
- âœ… Implement automated deployment to production

### Phase 7: Performance Testing
- Add performance tests for critical paths
- Implement load testing for important components
- Create benchmarks for baseline performance
- Add monitoring and metrics

## Project Progress

### Phase 1: Setup Testing Infrastructure âœ…
- Jest testing framework set up
- Directory structure created
- CountdownTimer component extracted and tested with 100% coverage

### Phase 2: Code Modularization âœ…
- Monolithic script broken into component modules:
  - CountdownTimer
  - AudioManager
  - InteractiveMap
- Core utilities developed:
  - eventBus for component communication
  - domUtils for DOM manipulation
- Main app controller created to orchestrate components

### Phase 3: Component Refactoring âœ…
- Implemented section visibility with IntersectionObserver
- Added mud splat animations with tests
- Completed sound toggle button functionality
- Made components testable with proper dependency injection
- Decoupled UI manipulation from business logic

### Phase 4: Test Implementation âœ…
- Implemented comprehensive tests for AudioManager with 100% coverage
- All component methods are fully tested with edge cases
- Created mocks for DOM elements and browser APIs
- Event listeners and event bus communication are tested

### Phase 5: Coverage Optimization âœ…
- Achieved 100% statement and function coverage for eventBus utility
- Improved domUtils utility test coverage from 20% to 47%
- Fixed failing tests and implemented robust mocks
- Reached an overall coverage improvement from 39% to 44%
- Identified and implemented critical fixes for mobile menu functionality
- Created animation bridge for ES module and non-module environments
- Fixed failing AudioManager test for better test stability

### Phase 5.5: UI Refactoring & CSS Best Practices âœ…
- Created detailed CSS architecture documentation
- Developed comprehensive mobile menu refactoring plan
- Designed unified animation framework API
- Created CSS transition strategy to replace setTimeout-based animations
- Implementing proper state management for UI components
- Resolved test failures to ensure stable foundation for UI refactoring
- Fixed mobile menu open/close issues with proper event handling
- Integrated event bus for component communication
- Removed inline styles from mobile menu in favor of CSS classes
- Replaced inline data-position attributes with proper CSS classes
- Enhanced interactive map component to use CSS classes instead of direct style manipulation
- Implemented consistent CSS transitions for all interactive elements
- Created unified animation API with proper event handling
- Exposed animation API through window for non-module compatibility
- Updated tests to match new implementation
- Added deprecation notices for legacy animation functions
- Removed redundant window exposure for AnimationSystem
- Removed more inline style manipulations in favor of CSS classes
- Completely removed deprecated animation utilities in favor of the unified AnimationSystem API
- Deleted redundant legacy animation code for a cleaner codebase
- Simplified animation bridge to only expose the new unified API

## Details: Phase 6 CI/CD Integration

After completing the UI refactoring in Phase 5.5, we established a robust CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and automate deployments:

### GitHub Actions Implementation:
- Created workflows for automated testing on push and pull requests
- Set up build verification for all branches
- Implemented test coverage reporting
- Configured production deployment workflow

### Pre-commit Hooks:
- Set up Husky for Git hooks management
- Configured lint-staged for running tests on staged files
- Added ESLint for code quality checks
- Implemented automated code formatting with Prettier

### Deployment Automation:
- Created FTP deployment script for Namecheap hosting
- Implemented secure credential management
- Set up continuous deployment to production from master branch

### Code Quality Checks:
- Integrated ESLint for static code analysis
- Added Prettier for code formatting
- Implemented bundle size monitoring
- Configured performance budget checks

This phase established a solid foundation for maintaining code quality and streamlining the development workflow.

## Next Steps (Phase 6)
1. âœ… Set up GitHub Actions for CI
2. âœ… Configure Husky for pre-commit hooks
3. âœ… Implement ESLint and Prettier for code quality
4. âœ… Create deployment automation scripts
5. âœ… Set up code coverage reporting in CI
6. Test the CI/CD pipeline with a sample PR
7. âœ… Implement automated production deployment
