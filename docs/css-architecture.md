# CSS Architecture Plan for Phase 5.5

## Current Issues
- Inline styles with !important flags in HTML
- Direct style manipulation in JavaScript
- Timeout-based animation management
- Event propagation issues with mobile menu
- Display/visibility properties used for animations instead of transforms
- Mixed responsibility between JS and CSS

## Architecture Goals
1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - CSS for presentation only
   - JavaScript for behavior only
   - Clear state management

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use CSS transforms and opacity for animations
   - Hardware acceleration where appropriate
   - Minimize repaints and reflows

3. **Maintainability**
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Component-based CSS organization
   - Clear state transitions

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Mobile Menu
- Replace inline styles with proper CSS classes
- Create CSS transitions for menu animations
- Use transform/opacity instead of display/visibility
- Implement transition event listeners

### 2. Animation System
- Create a unified animation API
- Replace setTimeout with transitionend/animationend events
- Use CSS custom properties for animation values

### 3. State Management
- Implement clear state machines for UI components
- Use data-* attributes to indicate state
- Create utility classes for common state patterns

### 4. Z-Index Management
- Establish a documented z-index scale
- Create z-index variables
- Prevent stacking context issues

## Implementation Phases
1. Remove inline styles from HTML
2. Create proper CSS transitions for mobile menu
3. Refactor animation framework
4. Fix event propagation issues
5. Update tests to match new implementation
